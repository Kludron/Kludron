### Hello there! I'm Liam :wave:

Iâ€™m a Graduate Software and Security Engineer at a company called [Internet 2.0](https://internet2-0.com), having recently completed a Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia. I post semi-regularly on my blog [Lukewarm Security Info](https://lukewarmsecurityinfo.com) on a range on security / privacy topics.
